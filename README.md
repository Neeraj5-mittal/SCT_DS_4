# 🚗 Crash Insights: Traffic Accident Data EDA

This project is part of my **Data Science Internship at SkillCraft Technology**, where I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a real-world traffic accident dataset to uncover patterns in accident occurrence and severity.

---

## 📌 Objective

To analyze traffic accident data and identify how **time of day**, **weather conditions**, **lighting**, **road surface**, and **human behavior** contribute to the **frequency** and **severity** of accidents.

---

## 🧠 Key Insights

- ⏰ Accidents peak during **rush hours** and **weekends**
- 🌧️ Accidents are **more severe in foggy or rainy weather**
- 💡 **Low lighting** (especially without street lights) increases crash risk
- 🛣️ **Urban areas** are accident hotspots
- ⚠️ Top causes: **Overspeeding**, **Driver negligence**, and **lane discipline violations**

---

## 📊 Visualizations Included

- Accident frequency by **hour of day**
- Distribution by **day of week**
- Accidents under different **weather & light conditions**
- Severity analysis across **areas and causes**
- Correlation heatmap & pair plot of numerical features

---

## 💻 Tech Stack

- `Python`
- `Pandas` for data wrangling
- `Seaborn` and `Matplotlib` for visualization
- `LabelEncoder` for feature encoding
- `Jupyter Notebook`

---

## ✅ Conclusion

This project highlights how data-driven insights can help enhance road safety. The findings can assist in **policy making**, **traffic regulation**, and **urban infrastructure planning** to reduce accidents and save lives.
